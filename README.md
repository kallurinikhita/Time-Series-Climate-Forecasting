This project addresses the impact of global warming by analyzing temperature trends over time on both land and ocean surfaces. Utilizing The Global Land and Ocean-Temperature Anomaly Time Series dataset, which examines anomalies in annual mean temperature from pre-industrial levels, the study aims to forecast future temperature changes. The dataset, sourced from NASA’s GISS Surface Temperature Analysis and NOAA National Climatic Data Center, covers the period from 1880 to 2016, although the data used covers from 1905 to 2016, occurring after the pre-industrial so that the data is uniform. The analysis incorporates the assessment of the necessity for time series transformations, such as Box-Cox and log transformations, and incorporates seasonal and trend differencing to achieve stationarity of data. Multiple SARIMA models are fitted for forecasting, with model selection guided by the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The chosen model was a tested for normality through the process of diagnostic checking. The chosen model, SARIMA(2,1,2)(1,1,1)12, exhibits invertibility and successfully passes normality tests, qualifying it for fore- casting.
It’s important to acknowledge that the complexity of the data, influenced by factors like the inherent vari- ability of the climate system, natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, and unpredictable shifts in human con- tributions to emissions due to technological advances or events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, introduces nuances in the data. Consequently, deviations from the general pattern may occur, as is common with most data. Despite this, the final model slightly deviates from the observations in the actual dataset, although the confidence intervals effectively encompass the values.
